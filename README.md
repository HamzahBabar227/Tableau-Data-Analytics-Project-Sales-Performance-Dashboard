# Tableau Data Analytics Project – Sales Performance Dashboard

## End-to-End Sales Performance Analysis with Tableau

This project delivers an end-to-end Tableau data analytics solution that translates stakeholder user stories into interactive Sales Performance dashboards. It is designed to support sales managers and executives in analyzing year-over-year performance, trends, and product-level insights to drive data-informed decision-making.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to design and build executive-ready Tableau dashboards that provide a clear, high-level view of sales performance while enabling deeper analytical exploration.

Using multi-table sales data, the dashboards answer real business questions related to sales growth, profitability, product performance, and weekly trends.

## Data Preparation & Modeling in Tableau

The project began by extracting and integrating 10,000+ rows of sales data across multiple tables, including Orders, Products, Customers, and Locations.

Key data engineering steps included:
- Cleansing and validating data to handle missing values and inconsistencies
- Verifying joins and relationships to ensure accurate aggregations
- Enforcing correct data types and grain alignment
- Building a scalable Tableau data model optimized for performance and reporting accuracy

These steps ensured reliable KPI reporting and analytical integrity.

## Dashboard Design & Visualization

Using Tableau Desktop, I built an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard featuring:

- KPI summary tiles for Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity with YoY comparison
- Monthly time-series trends highlighting highest and lowest performing months
- Product subcategory analysis comparing sales and profit side-by-side
- Weekly sales and profit trends with average reference lines and conditional highlighting
- Advanced tooltips to surface contextual metrics on hover
- Interactive filters and dashboard actions to enable drill-down exploration

Best-practice design principles were applied, including clean layouts, consistent color usage, reduced visual clutter, and executive-friendly labeling to deliver a polished, decision-ready dashboard.
