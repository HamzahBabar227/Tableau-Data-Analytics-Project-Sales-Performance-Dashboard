Tableau Data Analytics Project – Sales Performance Dashboard
Sales Performance & Customer Insights (Tableau)

This project delivers an end-to-end Tableau Sales Performance Dashboard built from stakeholder user stories to help sales managers and executives analyze year-over-year performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions using real-world sales data.

Business Context & User Story

Sales leaders need a clear, high-level view of performance while retaining the ability to drill into trends and drivers.
This project was designed to answer real business questions around:

How are sales, profit, and quantity performing year over year?

Which months and weeks drive peak or underperformance?

Which product subcategories contribute most to sales and profit?

Where should leadership focus attention based on trends and deviations?

Data Preparation & Modeling in Tableau

I began by connecting and modeling multiple CSV tables (Orders, Products, Customers, and Locations) directly in Tableau.
Key steps included:

Validating joins and relationships across fact and dimension tables

Enforcing correct data types and handling missing values

Verifying aggregates and totals to ensure reporting accuracy

This created a scalable and reliable data model for enterprise-style reporting.

Dashboard Design & Analytics

Using stakeholder requirements, I built an interactive executive dashboard featuring:

KPI cards for Sales, Profit, and Quantity with current-year vs previous-year comparison

Monthly time-series trends with highest and lowest months clearly highlighted

Product subcategory comparisons showing sales alongside profit

Weekly sales and profit trends with average reference lines and above/below indicators

Interactive filters, parameters, calculated fields, and advanced tooltips for contextual insights

Design choices focused on clarity, consistency, and executive readability.

Key Insights

Clear seasonality in sales performance with identifiable peak and low months

Specific subcategories driving revenue but underperforming on profit

Weekly volatility highlighted through average benchmarks and conditional indicators

YoY comparisons surfaced growth areas and segments requiring intervention

What I Learned

Translating business user stories into analytical requirements

Data modeling and validation directly within Tableau

Building calculated fields, parameters, YoY logic, and KPI frameworks

Designing interactive, executive-ready dashboards focused on decision-making

Using visual cues and tooltips to surface insights without clutter

Main Takeaway

Data visualization is not just about reporting metrics.
When built from business questions, dashboards become decision tools that guide strategy, highlight risk, and uncover opportunity.
